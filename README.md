# ISWC2023_IDO

This repo is now an ARCHIVE retained to house the ontology presented at ISWC and the associated paper.

For those interested in ongoing work on this ontology, there is a new repo at https://github.com/PCA-POSC-Caesar-Association/IDO_Use_Case_Pump_with_firmware. This repo is private but if you are interested in participating in the IDO development process and use cases, please contact the IDO Project Manager Rylandsholm, PÃ¥l <Pal.Rylandsholm@dnv.com>

This repo contain a record of the files submitted to support ISWC 2023 Industry paper submission

A copy of the pdf paper is in the root folder of this repo ISWC_IDO_singleColumn.pdf 

This site contains the following.

This contains:

1. A copy of the IDOPumpWithFirmware_v0_0_x.omn file for the case study described in the ISWC 2023 submission paper `Automated verification of measurement precision for internet-of-things equipment'. Please select the latest version.

2. This should import the upper (IDO) ontology IDO.tll.

3. To explore the case study ontology, open the IDOPumpWithFirmware_v0_0_x.omn in Protege, open the Entities>Class hierarchy tab. To see just IDO or just the case study classes use the View menu. use the Individuals menu to see the instance data. To run the reasoner please load and run Pellet (note this is available through the File>Check for Plugins menu). Our intention is to allow reviewers and interested party to see the ontology with limited instance data for illustrative purposes.

4. A copy of the IDO document (WD_IDO.pdf) submitted to ISO TC184 SC4 and approved as a new work item under a new WG26 in June 2023. Interested readers can get a comprehensive view of the IDO ontology from this document.

5. In the Appendix of WD_IDO.pdf there is a more full description of the pump use case including class diagrams to supplement the 2-page overview submitted to ISWC. Please see page 94.

6. Note please that while this document provides a comprehensive description of IDO and includes, in the Appendix, a full description of the case study summarised in the ISWC paper. There are some minor gaps in ancillary parts of the IDO document that will be addressed during the standardisation process.

7. The OTTR templates developed for this model are not included in this GitHub.
