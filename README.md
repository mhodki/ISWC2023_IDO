2. This should import the upper (IDO) ontology LIS-14.omn. If it does not use the import function in Protege

3. To explore the case study ontology, open the IDOPumpWithFirmware_v0_0_2.omn in Protege, open the Entities>Class hierarchy tab. To see just IDO or just the case study classes use the View menu. use the Individuals menu to see the instance data. To run the reasoner please load and run Pellet (note this is available through the File>Check for Plugins menu).

3. Note please that while this document provides a comprehensive description of IDO and includes, in the Appendix, a full description of the case study summarised in the ISWC paper. There are some minor gaps in ancillary parts of the IDO document that will be addressed during the standardisation process.

4. A copy of the \*.ttl file for IDO representing the version submitted to ISO. This is an evolving ttl file and includes some enhancements since the work on the IDOPumpWithFirmware_v0_0_2.omn which imports LIS-14.omn.
